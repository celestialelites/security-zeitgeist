### Adversarial OSS Projects

- [Alibi Detect Python library]([GitHub - SeldonIO/alibi-detect: Algorithms for outlier and adversarial instance detection, concept drift and metrics.](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect)) - outlier, adversarial and drift detection. The package aims to cover both online and offline detectors for tabular data, text, images and time series. The outlier detection methods should allow the user to identify global, contextual and collective outliers.
